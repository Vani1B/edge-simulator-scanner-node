# ðŸ“¡ Edge Scanner Telemetry Monitoring with AWS & Datadog

This project simulates a real-time edge computing scenario where barcode scanners (as edge devices) send telemetry data to a central system hosted on AWS. The telemetry is monitored using Datadog, with dashboards and alerts configured to ensure availability, performance, and proactive remediation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Simulate edge scanner telemetry (e.g., scan count, failure rate, latency)
- Ingest metrics into Datadog for real-time observability
- Visualize scanner performance through dashboards
- Set up alerting for scanner anomalies
- Automate service restart if telemetry agent fails

Launch Ec2 instance with type t2.micro

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28f4656e-99f1-40ea-9866-4233366a521c)

ssh to the instance and install boto3 inside a python virtual environment

Create file name scanner_telemetry.py and add the python script 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c988b1-54c1-4efd-9f4b-0bd13f5905f4)

Run python scanner_telemetry.py to see the logs locally

Now to push these logs to Aws cloud watch, attach IAM role to the instance

Change the python script to cloudwatch logs

Now loginto Cloud watch log and go to log groups find scanner telemetry

Lets connect AWS to Datadog (CloudWatch Integration). Go to Datadog dashboard and select linux

Install Datadog agent in Ec2 instance

To push the logs from cloudwatch to datadog we need datadog forwarder. Used cloud formation to create datadog forwarder

Now in CloudWatch create subscription filter to connect Lambda. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dce4e35b-eefa-4ad7-89d8-8f05770d75db)

Now go to Lambda, copy ARN and add the ARN to Datadag Integration
